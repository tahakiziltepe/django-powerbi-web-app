# Django Power BI Web App

This app uses Power BI REST API. For now, there is very limited features; however, I am going to develop new ones by the time. I am aiming to enhance my Back-End skills, therefore I do not spend time for Front-End in this project.
You must have an account that has permissions to read data by REST API.

What you can do:
1. You can see your capacities, workspaces (top 5) and datasets (top 5) in one page. Also, how many workspaces is involved in every each capacity and how many datasets is involved in every each workspace.
2. There is a page which shows all workspaces.

To use:
1. Go to admin panel. Username and password are "admin".
2. Go to PowerBI_Settings model and add one.
3. Click view site and click update. For now, you have to update in order (Capacity -> Workspace -> Dataset) because they are used hierarchy.

Developments will come up.
